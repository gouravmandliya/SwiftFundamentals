//MARK:- ForEach
//forEach calls the given closure on each element in the sequence in the same order as a for-in loop.


//MARK:- Important Note :
//Using the forEach method is distinct from a for-in loop in two important ways:

//1. You cannot use a break or continue statement to exit the current call of the body closure or skip subsequent calls.

//2. Using the return statement in the body closure will exit only from the current call to body, not from any outer scope, and wonâ€™t skip subsequent calls.
